                        <br>
                        <p>Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a social science. The social sciences include, but are not limited to, economics, political science, human geography, demography, management, psychology, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.</p>
                        <p>Positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Branches of social science</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Anthropology</strong> - study of humans, past and present, that draws and builds upon knowledge from the social sciences and biological sciences, as well as the humanities and the natural sciences.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anthropology of religion</strong> – study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures</p>
                        <p><strong>Applied anthropology</strong> – application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems.</p>
                        <p><strong>Archaeology</strong> – study of cultures via material remains and environmental data (Outline of archaeology)</p>
                        <p><strong>Cultural anthropology</strong> – branch of anthropology focused on the study of cultural variation among humans, collecting data about the effect of global economic and political processes on local cultural realities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ethnobiology</strong> – scientific study of dynamic relationships between peoples, biota, and environments, from the distant past to the immediate present.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ethnobotany</strong> – is the study of a region's plants and their practical uses through the traditional knowledge of a local culture and people.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ethnobotany</strong> – systematic study of people and cultures.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ethnology</strong> – branch of anthropology that compares and analyzes the origins, distribution, technology, religion, language, and social structure of the ethnic, racial, and/or national divisions of humanity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ethnology</strong> – method of recording text versions of oral poetry or narrative performances (i.e., verbal lore) that uses poetic lines, verses, and stanzas (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts.</p>
