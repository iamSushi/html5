                    <h2>Engineering</h2>
                    <p>Engineering is the application of mathematics, science, economics, empirical evidence, social, and practical knowledge to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.</p>
                    <p>The discipline of engineering encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application.</p>
                    <h2>Engineering courses that University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines offers</h2>
                    <h3>MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEGREE</h3>
                    <p>A Mechanical Engineering Degree involves the design of mechanical systems. These systems assist industries such as: manufacturing, aeronautics, nanotechnology, nuclear power production, heating and cooling.  A primary focus is on thermodynamics, structural analysis, materials science, and kinematics. This is arguably the broadest of all engineering degrees available today and takes in a wide range of engineering disciplines. The Mechanical Engineering Degree has a number of subsets that intermix with electronics and electrical engineering, such as Mechatronics.</p>
                    <h3>CIVIL ENGINEERING DEGREE</h3>
                    <p>Civil Engineering involves the development of infrastructure such as buildings, railways, roads construction, bridges and general construction project management. Civil Engineers also play an important role in rebuilding projects, such as in the event of a natural disaster. Civil Engineers may work in the private or public sector at any level. This is a very broad engineering degree. Environmental Engineering, Structural Engineering and Marine Engineering are all specialties of Civil Engineering.</p>
                    <h3>ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEGREE</h3>
                    <p>An Electrical Engineering Degree involves the study of energy. Energy is available in various forms such as electrical, hydro and natural sources such as wind and solar energy. An Electrical Engineer develops technologies to assist with the practical application of such energies. Electrical Engineers design components for electronic equipment, communications systems, power grids, automobiles, and more. Most employers require an Electrical Engineering Degree at some level to work as an Electrical Engineer, and other licensing or certification requirements may also be required depending on where you live.</p>
                    <h3>COMPUTER ENGINEERING DEGREE</h3>
                    <p>Another industry that continues to expand is of course the Information Technology (IT) industry. This involves both computer sciences and electrical engineering. Successful graduates may find themselves in Telecommunications, Networking, Software Application Development, or Manufacturing, and additional industries are emerging, such as Application Development, Web Development, Network Security / Cybersecurity, and Cloud Computing, among others. This type of degree has good future potential as most industries rely on information technology. Read more about the computer engineering degree.</p>
                    <h3>CHEMICAL ENGINEERING DEGREE</h3>
                    <p>As the name implies, Chemical Engineering is the practical application of chemistry. This type of engineering degree involves technology that utilizes chemical reactions to solve problems. A chemical engineer creates new products, including: Cosmetics, foods, pharmaceuticals, beverages, and cleaners from raw chemicals. this is a very broad engineering degree and allows for a number of different forms of employment. It is also one of the most challenging degrees available.</p>
                    <h3>ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING</h3>
                    <p>Electronics and Communication Engineering deals with the electronic devices, circuits, communication equipments like transmitter, receiver, integrated circuits (IC). It also deals with basic electronics, analog and digital transmission and reception of data, voice and video (Example AM, FM, DTH), microprocessors, satellite communication, microwave engineering, antennae and wave progression. It aims to deepen the knowledge and skills of the students on the basic concepts and theories that will equip them in their professional work involving analysis, systems implementation, operation, production, and maintenance of the various applications in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering.</p>
